# PRODIGY_INFO_TECH
An insight  into the realms of Data Science with Prodigy TechInfo (PTI).


# Overview
This Jupyter notebook is part of an internship program at PRODIGY_TECH_INFO, focusing on practical data analysis and machine learning tasks. Each task within the notebook is designed to tackle specific challenges in data science, offering hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

# Task Details

## Task 01: Data Visualization
Objective: Visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as ages or genders in a population, using bar charts or histograms.

Techniques Used: matplotlib and seaborn for plotting; pandas for data manipulation.

Outcome: This task aims to provide an intuitive understanding of the data's distribution, highlighting significant patterns that can inform further analysis.

## Task 02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Perform comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships between variables and identify trends within the data.

Techniques Used: pandas for data cleaning and manipulation; matplotlib and seaborn for exploratory visualization.

Outcome: Prepares the dataset for modeling by identifying missing values, outliers, and feature correlations. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

## Task 03: Build a Decision Tree Classifier
Objective: Develop a decision tree classifier to predict outcomes based on certain input variables.

Techniques Used: sklearn for modeling; pandas for data manipulation; matplotlib and seaborn for model evaluation metrics visualization.

Outcome: Demonstrates the application of a machine learning algorithm to classify data, providing insights into the model's decision-making process and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

## Task 04: Analyze and Visualize Sentiment Patterns
Objective: Analyze datasets to identify sentiment patterns, focusing on understanding consumer attitudes or preferences.

Techniques Used: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis; matplotlib and seaborn for visualization of sentiment distributions.

Outcome: Offers valuable insights into the prevailing sentiments within a dataset, aiding in decision-making processes related to marketing strategies, product development, and customer service improvements.

## Task 05: Analyze Traffic Accident Data
Objective: Investigate traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Techniques Used: pandas for data manipulation; matplotlib, seaborn, and possibly geographic mapping tools for visualization.

Outcome: Aims to enhance road safety by providing data-driven insights into accident causes, potentially influencing policy changes or improvements in traffic management practices.

## Conclusion
This notebook is designed as a comprehensive guide for aspiring data scientists to apply various data science techniques, ranging from basic visualizations to complex machine learning models. Through these tasks, interns are expected to gain valuable experience that will aid in their professional development in the field of data science.
